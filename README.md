# Hangman-Python
The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where players try to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters. Players have six lives, losing one for each incorrect guess. The game features ASCII art to show progress. This Python project helps practice loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
