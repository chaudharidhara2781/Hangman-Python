🎮 Hangman Game - Python Command Line
Welcome to the Hangman Game, a fun command-line game written in Python! In this game, you'll be guessing a randomly chosen word, one letter at a time. But be careful—make too many wrong guesses, and you’ll lose all your lives (and the poor hangman 😢)!

✨ Features:
Random Word Generator: Every time you play, a word is picked at random from a list. No two games are the same!
Guessing Letters: You'll try to guess the word, one letter at a time.
Lives System: You have six lives. Each wrong guess costs a life—so choose wisely!
Visual Hangman: With each wrong guess, parts of the hangman are drawn on the screen. Lose all your lives, and it's game over for the hangman (and you)!
Smart Guesses: The game reminds you if you’ve already guessed a letter.
Victory or Defeat: Win by guessing all the letters, or lose if you run out of lives.

🚀 How to Play:
When you start the game, you'll see blanks representing the letters of a hidden word.
Enter a letter to guess if it’s part of the word.
If it is, the letter will fill in the blanks.
If it’s not, you’ll lose a life, and the hangman will get one step closer to the end.
Keep guessing until:
You reveal the entire word (yay, you win! 🎉), or
You lose all your lives (uh-oh, game over! 😬).

🛠️ How to Run:
Clone this repository.
Run the Python script main.py.
Follow the on-screen instructions to guess letters!

📦 Files Included:
word_list.py: Contains the list of words the game will pick from.
hangman_art.py: Contains the ASCII art for the hangman and the game’s logo.

🎯 Goals:
This project is a simple, fun way to practice Python, especially concepts like loops, conditionals, lists, and handling user input. It’s also a great introduction to building command-line applications!
